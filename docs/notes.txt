======= Data Modelling ========
The process of organizing data objects in meaningful way and define relationship among them.

>> Types:
1. Conceptual Data Model: Highest level of abstraction. Only define the tables/data objects.
2. Logical Data Model: Defines PK, FK and entity relationships like 1-to-1, 1-to-many etc.
3. Physical Data Model: Defines data types of the columns and actual data stored in DB tables.

(1) and (2) are widely used in the industry.

======= Dimension and Fact Table =========
1. Dimension Table: Contains descriptive information about the data.
   e.g. Customers Table contains data about customers
   		Products Table contains different attributes of products.
2. Fact Table: Contains events or transactions and helfl in aggregations to derive insights.
   e.g. Sales Table contains information about sale of different products, their order value, order date, shipping date etc.

======= Dimension and Measures =========
We can categorize columns in a table into dims and measures.
If NOT Numeric - Measure, e.g. Category, ProductName, Subcategory, Birthdate. We can GROUP data by Measures.
If Numeric & make sense to be aggregated - Fact, e.g. Sales, Quantity, Age, Price

Note: CustomerID can be Numeric but it doesn't make sense to aggregate it. So, CustomerID is a Dimension NOT a Measure.
